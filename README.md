# Getting Started with Create React App

Here you will find all of the bigger projects that I've worked on.
At first you might think that three projects is not a big deal but, I would like to point out that these are all finished projects with working demos.
A great deal of emphasis was put on the logic behind these projects rather than design or appearance. In doing so these projects have all of the standard features that a web application should have and then, some more.

## DEMO-s and description bellow,

### `Find a Coach`

[DEMO](https://vue-http-demo-49523.web.app). 
I worked this project when I was finishing the course on [Vue - The Complete Guide (incl. Router & Composition API)](https://www.udemy.com/course/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/).
Here you will find a working demo that is being hosted on firebase. [Find a Coach](https://vue-http-demo-49523.web.app) 



### `World Wide Lottery`

This project was assigned to me by Solaborate Company when I applied for internship two months ago.

### `MoviesApp`

MoviesApp is the project that was assigned to me by 'BeetRoot Academy' lecturer - Gentrit Halili.
This application is dependent on a locally hosted server for the backend, therefore it is not hosted and does not have a working demo.
