# Getting Started with Create React App

Here you will find all of the bigger projects that I've worked on.
At first you might think that three projects is not a big deal but, I would like to point out that these are all finished projects with working demos.
A great deal of emphasis was put on the logic behind these projects rather than design or appearance. In doing so these projects have all of the standard features that a web application should have and then, some more.

## DEMO-s and description bellow,

## Find a Coach
### `Vue3`

## MoviesApp
### `ReactJS`

MoviesApp is the project that was assigned to me by 'BeetRoot Academy' lecturer - Gentrit Halili.
This application is dependent on a locally hosted server for the backend, therefore it is not hosted and does not have a working demo.



## MyBurger
### `ReactJS`

[DEMO](https://react-my-burger-cfe39.web.app/)

The birger builder app is the first big project that I did when learning react the first time around.
I did not include it's source code because I lost it with my old laptop, but, I do have a working demo hosted on firebase [MyBurger](https://react-my-burger-cfe39.web.app/)
