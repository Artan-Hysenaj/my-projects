# My Projects

Here you will find all of the bigger projects that I've worked on.
A great deal of emphasis was put on the logic behind these projects rather than design or appearance. In doing so these projects have all of the standard features that a web application should have and then some more.

## DEMO-s and description below,

## Errday Snippets
### `ReactJS`

[DEMO](https://candid-travesseiro-2035f0.netlify.app)

The My snippets project was an inspiration from a youtube video where the whole project was developed with NextJS and some third-party libraries. In an attempted act of aggresion towards my boredom I decided to redo the whole thing with ReactJS and do everything myself wihout any third-party libraries.
