# My Projects

Here you will find all of the bigger projects that I've worked on.
I would like to point out that these are all finished projects with working demos.
A great deal of emphasis was put on the logic behind these projects rather than design or appearance. In doing so these projects have all of the standard features that a web application should have and then some more.

## DEMO-s and description bellow,
